Weekly Schedule Tracker
A simple, single-page web application designed to help you track your work hours against a weekly goal. It calculates the total hours worked, the remaining hours needed, and suggests a daily average for the rest of the week to help you stay on track.
✨ Features
Set a Weekly Goal: Easily define your target total hours for the week.
Daily Hour Tracking: Input the hours worked for each day of the week.
Real-time Calculations: Instantly see your total hours worked and remaining hours.
Daily Average Suggestion: The tool automatically calculates the average number of hours you need to work each day for the remainder of the week.
Hours & Minutes Conversion: The daily average is shown in both decimal format (e.g., 8.5 hours) and a more readable hours and minutes format (e.g., 8 hours and 30 minutes).
Simple Reset: A one-click button to clear all inputs and start fresh.
